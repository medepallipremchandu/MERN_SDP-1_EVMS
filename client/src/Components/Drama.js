  <h1>Drama:</h1>
  <h3>Drama is the specific mode of fabrication represented in performance a play, pieces, mimic, ballet,etc., performed in a theatre, or on radio or TV. (1) Considered as a kidney of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been varied with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's Poetics (c. 335 BC) — the foremost work of dramatic proposition. The term" drama"comes from a Greek word"draō" meaning"to do/ to act" ( Classical Greek δρᾶμα, drama), which is deduced from"I do" ( Classical Greek δράω, drao). The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional general division between comedy and tragedy. In English (as was the similar case in numerous other European languages), the word play or game ( rephrasing the Anglo-Saxon pleġan or Latin ludus) was the standard term for dramatizations until William Shakespeare's time — just as its creator was a play-maker rather than a dramatist and the structure was a play- house rather than a theatre. The use of" drama"in a further narrow sense to designate a specific type of play dates from the ultramodern period." Drama"in this sense refers to a play that's neither a comedy nor a tragedy — for illustration, Zola's Thérèse Raquin (1873) or Chekhov's Ivanov (1887). It's this narrower sense that the film and TV diligence, along with film studies, espoused to describe" drama"as a kidney within their separate media. The term” radio drama “ has been used in both senses — firstly transmitted in a live performance. May also relate to the further high-brow and serious end of the dramatic affair of radio. The enactment of drama in theatre, performed by actors on a stage before an followership, presupposes cooperative modes of product and a collaborative form of event. The structure of dramatic textbooks, unlike other forms of literature, is directly told by this cooperative product and collaborative event. Mime is a form of drama where the action of a story is told only through the movement of the body. Drama can be combined with music the dramatic textbook in pieces is generally sung throughout; as for in some ballets cotillion"expresses or imitates emotion, character, and narrative action".  Adaptations include both spoken dialogue and songs; and some forms of drama have incidental music or musical incident emphasizing the dialogue ( psychodrama and Japanese Nō, for illustration).  Closet drama is a form that's intended to be read, rather than performed.  In extemporization, the drama doesn't antedate the moment of performance; players concoct a dramatic script spontaneously before an followership</h3>
