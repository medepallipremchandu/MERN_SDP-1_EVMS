  <h1>Art Showcase:</h1>
  <h3>Art Show is a competition that recognizes both the stylish individual artists and stylish art programs in North Carolina seminaries. An unlimited number of scholars in each academy may share in the academy- position competition. Scholars are presented with a prompt and given about one month to produce their submission. Media orders include oil, delineation, collage, photography, and other creative sweats. Electronic clones of cessions are transferred to NCASA and encouraged to judges. Cessions from top brigades and scholars from each order advance to the State Tests and are estimated by judges in a live exhibition.
Art Show challenges artists of different media from different seminaries in a judged competition that awards both individual and group prizes.. Scholars produce their artwork and enter the competition by submitting digital images of their work.
